## Debugging applications on a server


You can debug applications on a server to detect and diagnose errors in your application. Use the TCP/IP monitor view to view data sent and received over the ports of the server. In addition, use the debugging tools in the workbench to control running your application on the server by setting breakpoints, suspending threads, stepping through the code, and examining the contents of the variables.
